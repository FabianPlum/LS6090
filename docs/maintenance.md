# LS6090 Laser Cutter Maintenance Document

### Overview
Regular maintenance of the LS6090 laser cutter ensures optimal performance, longevity, and safety. This document outlines the recommended maintenance tasks, frequencies, and instructions for each key component of the machine.

### **1. Water Cooler (Chiller)**

The water cooler is hidden behind the laser cutter and is essential for regulating the temperature of the laser tube. Regular checks and maintenance of the chiller ensure the laser cutter operates efficiently.

#### **Every 6 Months**
- **Check and Clean for Dust**  
  Inspect the sides of the chiller for accumulated dust. Clean it routinely to ensure efficient cooling.
  
- **Water Replacement**  
  Use **DI (Deionized) water** for the chiller, approximately **6 liters**. Replace the water every **3 to 4 months**.
  
- **Hose Connection**  
  Always verify that the hose connections are correct:
  - **Laser In** → **Chiller Out**
  - **Laser Out** → **Chiller In**

#### **Additional Tasks when Replacing Water**
- **Clean the X and Y Rails**  
  Before replacing the water, ensure you clean the X and Y axes rails to remove any dust or debris.
  
- **Lubrication**  
  After cleaning the rails, apply **light oil** to lubricate all axes. Don’t forget to also oil the **Z-axis threads**.

### **2. Optics (Lenses and Mirrors)**

The lenses and mirrors are critical for the accuracy and precision of the laser cutter. Regular cleaning prevents residue build-up, which can degrade the cutting quality.

#### **Every Month**
- **Clean Lenses and Mirrors**  
  Use **Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA)** and a **cotton swab** to clean all lenses and mirrors. Clean both sides of each mirror and lens carefully.
  
- **Cleaning the Cutting Surface**  
  Wipe down the cutting surface regularly to prevent residue build-up. Use plenty of wipes to ensure no residue is left behind, as built-up residue becomes harder to clean over time.

### **3. BOFA Unit (Filtration System)**

The BOFA unit filters the exhaust from the laser cutter, ensuring a safe working environment. The filters should be replaced periodically to maintain proper filtration.

#### **Every 6 to 10 Months (or as needed)**
- **Replace Filters**  
  Replace the filters in the BOFA unit as needed, with the **lower filter** needing replacement about **twice as often** as the upper filter.

- **Order Replacement Filters in Pairs**  
  When replacing the lower filter, order **both upper and lower filters**. This ensures you can replace the upper filter immediately when needed, minimizing downtime.

---

### **4. General Notes**
- Perform all cleaning tasks with care, especially when handling lenses and mirrors to avoid damage.
- Keep a stock of essential supplies like DI water, IPA, cotton swabs, and replacement filters to avoid delays in maintenance.
  
By following this maintenance schedule, you will ensure the LS6090 laser cutter operates smoothly, efficiently, and safely for years to come.
